cuSZ: A GPU Accelerated Error-Bounded Lossy Compressor for Scientific Data
---

cuSZ is a CUDA implementation of the world-widely used [SZ lossy compressor](https://github.com/szcompressor/SZ). It is the first error-bounded lossy compressor on GPUs for scientific data, which significantly improves SZ's throughput in GPU-based heterogeneous HPC systems.

This document simply introduces how to install and use the cuSZ compressor on NVIDIA GPUs. More details can be found in doc/cusz-doc.pdf.

# set up
## requirements
- NVIDIA GPU with Pascal, Volta, or Turing microarchitectures 
- CUDA 9.2+ (recommended: CUDA 10.1+) and GCC 7+

## download
```bash
git clone git@github.com:szcompressor/cuSZ.git
```

## compile
```bash
cd cuSZ
export CUSZ_ROOT=$(pwd)
make
sudo make install   # optional given that it's a sudo
# otherwise, without `sudo make install`, `./$(CUSZ_ROOT)/bin/cusz` to execute
```

Commands `cusz` or `cusz -h` are for instant instructions.

## cuSZ as a compressor
### basic use

The basic use cuSZ is given below.

```bash
cusz -f32 -m r2r -e 1e-4 -i ./data/sample-cesm-CLDHGH -D cesm -z -x
       ^  ~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~  ^  ^
       |   mode   error         input datum file        demo   |  |
     dtype        bound                                 data  zip unzip
```
`-D cesm` specifies preset dataset for demonstration. In this case, it is CESM-ATM, whose dimension is 1800-by-3600, following y-x order. To otherwise specify datum file and input dimensions arbitrarily, we use `-2 3600 1800`, then it becomes

```bash
cusz -f32 -m r2r -e 1e-4 -i ./data/sample-cesm-CLDHGH -2 3600 1800 -z -x
```
To conduct compression, several input arguments are **necessary**,

- `-z` or `--zip` to compress
- `-x` or `--unzip` to decompress
- `-m` or `--mode` to specify compression mode. Options include `abs` (absolute value) and `r2r` (relative to value range).
- `-e` or `--eb` to specify error bound
- `-i` to specify input datum file
- `-D` to specify demo dataset name or `-{1,2,3}` to input dimensions


### tuning
There are also internal a) quant. code representation, b) Huffman codeword representation, and c) chunk size for Huffman coding exposed. Each can be specified with argument options.

- `-Q` or `--quant-rep`  to specify bincode/quant. code representation. Options `<8|16|32>` are for `uint8_t`, `uint16_t`, `uint32_t`, respectively. (Manually specifying this may not result in optimal memory footprint.)
- `-H` or `--huffman-rep`  to specify Huffman codeword representation. Options `<32|64>` are for `uint32_t`, `uint64_t`, respectively. (Manually specifying this may not result in optimal memory footprint.)
- `-C` or `--huffman-chunk`  to specify chunk size for Huffman codec. Should be a power-of-2 that is sufficiently large (`[256|512|1024|...]`). (This affects Huffman decoding performance *significantly*.)


### extension and use scenarios

#### preprocess 
Some application such as EXAFEL preprocesses with binning [^binning] in addition to skipping Huffman codec.

[^binning]: A current binning setting is to downsample a 2-by-2 cell to 1 point.

#### disabling modules
For EXAFEL, given binning and `uint8_t` have already resulted in a compression ratio of up to 16, Huffman codec may not be needed in a real-world use scenario, so Huffman codec can be skipped with `--skip huffman`.

Decompression can give a full preview of the whole workflow and writing data of the orignal size to the filesystem is long, so writing decompressed data to filesystem can be skipped with `--skip write.x`. 

A combination of modules can be `--skip huffman,write.x`.

Other module skipping for use scenarios are in development.

## cuSZ as an analytical tool

`--dry-run` or `-r` in place of `-a` and/or `-x` enables dry-run mode to get PSNR. This employs the feature of dual-quantization that the decompressed data is guaranteed the same with prequantized data.

## examples

1. run a 2D CESM demo at 1e-4 relative to value range

	```bash
	cusz -f32 -m r2r -e 1e-4 -i ./data/sample-cesm-CLDHGH -D cesm -z -x
	```
2. alternatively, to use full option name,

	```bash
	cusz -f32 --mode r2r --eb 1e-4 --input ./data/sample-cesm-CLDHGH \
		--demo cesm --zip --unzip
	```
3. run a 3D Hurricane Isabel demo at 1e-4 relative to value range

	```bash
	cusz -f32 -m r2r -e 1e-4 -i ./data/sample-hurr-CLOUDf48 -D huricanne -z -x
	```
4. run CESM demo with 1) `uint8_t`, 2) 256 quant. bins,

	```bash
	cusz -f32 -m r2r -e 1e-4 -i ./data/sample-cesm-CLDHGH -D cesm -z -x \
		-d 256 -Q 8
	```
5. in addition to the previous command, if skipping Huffman codec,

	```bash
	cusz -f32 -m r2r -e 1e-4 -i ./data/sample-cesm-CLDHGH -D cesm -z -x \
		-d 256 -Q 8 --skip huffman	# or `-X/-S huffman`
	```
6. some application such as EXAFEL preprocesses with binning [^binning] in addition to skipping Huffman codec

	```bash
	cusz -f32 -m r2r -e 1e-4 -i ./data/sample-cesm-CLDHGH -D cesm -z -x \
		-d 256 -Q 8 --pre binning --skip huffman	# or `-p binning`
	```
7. dry-run to get PSNR and to skip real compression or decompression; `-r` also works alternatively to `--dry-run`

	```bash
	cusz -f32 -m r2r -e 1e-4 -i ./data/sample-cesm-CLDHGH -D cesm --dry-run	# or `-r`
	```


## tested datasets

We have successfully tested cuSZ on the following datasets from [Scientific Data Reduction Benchmarks](https://sdrbench.github.io/):
- CESM-ATM (Climate simulation)
- Hurricane ISABEL (Weather simulation)
- EXAALT (Molecular dynamics simulation)
- HACC (Cosmology: particle simulation)
- NYX (Cosmology: Adaptive mesh hydrodynamics + N-body cosmological simulation)
- EXAFEL (Images from the LCLS instrument)

## limitations of this version

- For this release, cuSZ only supports 32-bit `float`-type datasets. We will support 64-bit `double`-type datasets in the future release. 
- The compression ratio of current cuSZ may be different from SZ on CPU. Unlike SZ, cuSZ so far does not include an LZ-based lossless compression as the last step for compression throughput consideration; in other words, the compression ratio is up to 32. We are working on an efficient LZ-based lossless compression to be integrated into cuSZ in the future release.
- For this release, compressed data is saved in five files, including `.canon` file for canonical codebook (for decompression), `.hbyte` file for Huffman bitstream, `.hmeata` file for chucked Huffman bitstream metadata, `.outlier` file for unpredicted data with its metadata (in `CSR` format), and yet anther metadata pack, `.yamp`. Moreover, if you use `--skip huffman`, `uint<8|16|32>_t` quantization codes are saved in `.b<8|16|32>` file. We will change the compressed format in the next release. 
- The current integrated Huffman codec runs with efficient histogramming [1], GPU-sequential codebook building, memory-copy style encoding, chunkwise bit deflating, and corresponding canonical Huffman decoding [2], however, the chunkwise bit deflating is not optimal. We are woking on a faster, finer-grained Huffman codec for the future release. 
- We are working on refactoring to support more predictors, preprocessing methods, and compression modes. More functionalities will be released in the next release.
- Please use `-H 64` for HACC dataset because 32-bit representation is not enough for multiple HACC variables. Using `-H 32` will make cuSZ report an error. We are working on automatically adpating 32- or 64-bit representation for different datasets. 
- You may see a performance degradation when handling large-size dataset, such as 1-GB or 4-GB HACC. We are working on autotuning consistent performance.
- Please refer to [_Project Management page_](https://github.com/szcompressor/cuSZ/projects/2) for more todos.
